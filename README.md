This repositry contains the whole project of the programming assignment for the [Advanced Computational Methods in Drug Discovery course](https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/en/courses/115512/advanced-computational-methods-in-drug-discovery-ai-and-physics-based-simulations) taught by Assistant Professor Jespers Willem. The contibutors of the project is Pantelis Maragkoudakis Panagiotis Dimitropoulos and Ehsan Aslam.
Computer-aided drug design (CADD) comprises a broad range of theoretical and computational approaches that are part of modern drug discovery. CADD methods have made key contributions to the development of drugs that are in clinical use or in clinical trials. Such methods have emerged and evolved along with experimental approaches used in drug design. In this project  we will use some of the main advances in the field, such as Machine Learning prediction models, Docking, Interaction Fingerprints and generation of a Database of all the known inhibitors for the given target. The main aim of the project is to generate new potential selective inhibitors for the human Thrombin, by taking into consideration all the output of the Machine Learning Models and the steps of the Drug Discovery process. Our goal is to generate a set of ligands that are orientated in the binding pocket identical or even better compared with well known already synthesized in the lab compounds. Furthermore, we focus not only on the scores but also on the retrosynthesis path of the compounds. Our number one priority is to generate compounds that can be actually made in the wet lab.

For this project we used:
- The well known [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html), which provides an intuitive flow.
- A good amount of the scripts were obtained by the [TeachOpenCADD](https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd),an open source programming packages for cheminformatics and structural bioinformatics are powerful tools to build modular, reproducible, and reusable pipelines for computer-aided drug design (CADD). Programming language `python`.
- We also used scripts for the CBR-teaching, an environment that was made by Willem Jespers for the aim of this course. Programming language `python`.
- For the Interaction Fingerprints we use the [Open Drug Discovery Toolkit](https://github.com/oddt/oddt),a  modular and comprehensive toolkit for use in cheminformatics, molecular modeling etc. ODDT is written in `python`, and make extensive use of Numpy/Scipy
- The re-written code is now embedded within the Jupyter Notebook . Especially we used the Noteable environment.


## Thrombin: Target discription 

### Protein information
Thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease (peptidase S1 family) that is known to be the central protease of the human blood coagulation cascade and is located extracellularly. (F2 - Prothrombin - Homo sapiens (Human) | UniProtKB | UniProt, z.d.) In this coagulation cascade, Prothrombin (coagulation factor II) is proteolytically cleaved to form thrombin. Next, soluble fibrinogen is formed into insoluble strands of fibrin by serine acting thrombin to form fibrin cloths in injured cells. Similarly, thrombin has a positive regulatory effects on coagulation factors and induces procoagulant, inflammatory, cellular proliferation and anticoagulant mechanism in the body. (Al-Amer, 2022) 

### Pathogenesis 
In the case of deregulation of thrombin in the blood coagulation cascade, abnormalities can occur which range from minor subclinical to serious life-threatening coagulopathies, i.e., during septicemia. (Danckwardt et al., 2013) Thrombin is multifunction and is not limited to only coagulator functions. Thrombin is involved in the innate and adaptive immune system and directs platelets, endothelial cells and various effector cells of the immune system which if deregulated can lead to sepsis. (Rittirsch et al., 2008) In both acute and chronic inflammation processes thrombin activates the complement cascade, or functions as a mitogen for immune effector cells. (Coughlin, 2000) When deregulated, abnormal platelet mediated thrombin upregulation can lead to excessive blood clotting and thrombosis.(Sambrano et al., 2001) 
Haemostasis plays an inherent part in the physiological regeneration processes, which are also engaged during tumorigenesis. (Dvorak, 2015) Thrombin and fibrin synthesis is directly activated by coagulator substances produced by tumour cells and/or indirectly via the activation of endothelial cells, thrombocytes, and leukocytes which produce cytokines, proteases, glycoproteins, and tissue factor-loaded microparticles. (Cancer, Clots and Consensus: New Understanding of an Old Problem - PMC, z.d.) This will eventually create a pro-tumorigenic micromilieu, driving drives cellular programs promoting cell growth, motility, angiogenesis, and invasiveness in tumours. (Nierodzik & Karpatkin, 2006)
As illustrated, thrombin is a multifaceted protein involved in many physiological processes and can negatively influence health when deregulates as these processes turn into pathophysiological conditions. This makes thrombin an ideal drug-target as an effective drug that regulates thrombin can be applied in many thrombin-related diseases and makes the drug highly impactful in the clinic. 

### Current drugs
Currently three classes of “Direct thrombin inhibitors” (DTIs) are available which act as anti-coagulants, directly inhibiting the enzymatic function of thrombin. (Sidhu et al., 2013) The three classes are, bivalent, univalent and allosteric inhibitors. The bivalent inhibitor mainly consists of large peptide molecules such as hirudin (Kim et al., 2008) and bivalirudin (Wakui et al., 2019). Univalent inhibitors involve small molecule inhibitors such as melagatran (Di Nisio et al., 2005) and inogatran (Kam et al., 2005) which share remarkable similarities with our newly designed ligand PEP1/2 in molecular structure, chemical groups, and size. 
As thrombin shows great levels of allosteric regulation, there is a growing interest in developing allosteric inhibitors for thrombin as it can function as a regulator instead of merely an inhibitor. Although advancements have been made with candidates such as sulfated pentagalloylglucopyranoside (SPGG)(Al-Horani & Desai, 2014), an allosteric inhibitor has yet to entered the clinic.
