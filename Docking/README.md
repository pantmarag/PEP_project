 # Docking process


Molecular docking is an established computational structure-based method used in drug discovery. It allows the identification of potential drug targets and predicting molecular ligand-target interactions at the atomic level. In this project we used the [AutodockVina](https://vina.scripps.edu/manual/) for as a docking scoring function. Because docking score does not provide a usefull information about the ligand-protein interaction, we did not rely on the score. The important output of the docking procedure in general, is the conformation of the ligand in the binding site. A proper conformation of the ligand in the binding site, can actually indicates a potential inhibition to the give target(Thrombin). Proper conformation means that the compound that we need to test conform all the crucial interactions with the key amino acids of the binding site.



For this project, we investigate the thrombin target and we were asked to find a potential new thrombin inhibitor. We took the [5AFZ](https://vina.scripps.edu/manual/)
