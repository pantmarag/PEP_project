# Discussion


By performing this procedure, we collected bioactivity data for our target of interest from the ChEMBL database. We filtered the data set in order to only contain molecules with measured IC50 bioactivity values.

Be aware that ChEMBL data originates from various sources. Compound data has been generated in different labs by different people all over the world. Therefore, we have to be cautious with the predictions we make using this data set. It is always important to consider the source of the data and consistency of data production assays when interpreting the results and determining how much confidence we have in our predictions.

Nonetheless, we see the top scored screened compounds based on the pIC50 that we will investigate more in order to propose new molecules and try to explain the more robust inhibition in the binding site based on ligand interactions inside the protein binding site.

# Disclaimer

In the data file, you can find the list of the compounds which inhibits the thrombin. They are ranked best to worst IC50 value. The file name is Thrombin
