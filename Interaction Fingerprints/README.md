In this project we wanted to introduce another one Drud Discovery Stategy called Interaction Fingerprints. In the protein-ligand interaction fingerprint (IFP)process, the details of protein-ligand interaction are encoding into a binary string using a set of predefined interaction types (van der Waals, π–π stacking, hydrogen bond, electrostatic interaction, and so on) and criteria . Using this encoded binary string, the binding features, given a ligand-bound complex, can be captured in great detail and easily manipulated. With this strategy we can easily do virtual screening, post-processing of dock poses and generate new scoring functions. So, using this technique we can easily assess some steps that we used in the whole procedure and also validate if our new generated ligands create the same types of interaction with the binding site compared with the ligand.
